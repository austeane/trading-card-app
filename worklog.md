# Worklog

## Instructions
- Work on the codebase as outlined in `PLAN.md`.
- Create and often update `worklog.md` with everything worked on.
- Write down any questions for the user in `worklog.md`.
- Make decisions to unblock yourself and note them (what/why) in `worklog.md` for later review.
- If blocked on any checkbox item, note it in `worklog.md` and move to another item.
- If a TODO is no longer relevant or should change, update it and note the decision in `worklog.md`.
- Do not return control until absolutely everything in `PLAN.md` has been attempted, linted and type-checked, verified via Playwright, and all issues found were attempted to fix.
- Keep session log timestamps with minutes and seconds.
- Use `AWS_PROFILE=prod npx sst dev` in the background and verify via Playwright on localhost with `/Users/austin/Desktop/IMG_7946.jpeg`.

## Session Log
- 2025-02-14 00:00:00: Initialized worklog and captured instructions. Next: review `PLAN.md` items and map to implementation tasks.
- 2025-02-14 00:00:00: Reviewed `PLAN.md` scope; tasks span Pre-Phase 5 critical fixes, Phase 5 tournament support (types + config + rendering + admin), plus UX/Admin/Polish/Production items. Starting with server/client/shared changes, then infra, then UI.
- 2025-02-14 00:00:00: Decision: Use optional write-secret enforcement (enabled only when `WRITE_SECRET` env var is set) to avoid breaking local dev; note in code + plan.
- 2025-02-14 00:00:00: Decision: For config/logos, attempt to scaffold S3 config endpoints and local seed JSON; actual logo uploads will be blocked pending assets.
- 2025-12-19 01:47:19: Updated worklog entries to include minutes and seconds (placeholder times used for earlier entries).
- 2025-12-19 02:54:47: Implemented Phase 5 groundwork: new shared card/tournament types, USQC 2025 fallback config (partial team list), server validation + UpdateCommand PATCH, optional WRITE_SECRET auth + rate limiting, config S3 endpoints, admin endpoints, and client tournament flow + dynamic form + live preview + crop derivative upload.
- 2025-12-19 02:54:47: Decision: Implemented card templates as `templateId` with Classic/Noir themes; stored on card and used in render.
- 2025-12-19 02:54:47: Decision: Crop derivative upload occurs on submit only (not on Save Draft) to reduce extra uploads; noted as a tradeoff.
- 2025-12-19 02:54:47: Blocker: Full 65-team USQC 2025 list and actual logo assets not present; seeded only a partial team list and required PNG logo uploads via admin.
- 2025-12-19 02:54:47: Blocker: Monitoring/CI/CD/WAF items from PLAN.md require infra work + external config; deferred and noted.
- 2025-12-19 02:54:47: Question: Do you want WRITE_SECRET enforced for public write endpoints in prod (requires a client-visible secret), or only for admin routes?
- 2025-12-19 02:54:47: Question: Can you provide the full USQC 2025 team list + logo assets (or a source file) so I can finish the config + logo uploads?
- 2025-12-19 03:13:49: Attempted `AWS_PROFILE=prod npx sst dev`; blocked by expired AWS SSO token (InvalidGrantException). Proceeded with Vite dev server + deployed Lambda URL for testing.
- 2025-12-19 03:13:49: Playwright test against deployed API found PATCH failure (400) because update payload still included `tournamentId`/`cardType`; fixed client update payload to strip those fields before PATCH.
- 2025-12-19 03:13:49: Second Playwright run hit PATCH 500; traced to UpdateCommand ExpressionAttributeNames mapping (segment->placeholder reversed). Fixed `server/src/index.ts` to map placeholder -> segment.
- 2025-12-19 03:13:49: Noted team logo fetch errors in console during Playwright runs (expected; assets not uploaded yet).
- 2025-12-19 03:13:49: Re-ran `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm lint` after fixes (both passing).
- 2025-12-19 03:15:17: Updated `PLAN.md` with new fixed issue entry and marked Monitoring/CI/CD as blocked; re-ran type-check/lint after server/client fixes.
- 2025-12-19 03:15:17: Question: Can you refresh AWS SSO (`aws sso login --profile prod`) or provide credentials so I can run `AWS_PROFILE=prod npx sst dev` for full end-to-end verification?
- 2025-12-19 09:57:03: SSO login confirmed; located legacy USQC assets at `~/dev/usqc2025`.
- 2025-12-19 09:57:03: Started `AWS_PROFILE=prod npx sst dev` (sst session 6554) and Vite dev server (client, port 5174) for localhost testing.
- 2025-12-19 09:57:03: Verified S3 config + team logo uploads (66 files) and updated `PLAN.md` to mark USQC 2025 config seeding/logo uploads complete; adjusted team count to 66.
- 2025-12-19 09:57:03: Playwright submission succeeded on localhost: selected USQC 2025, Player, UVA Quadball, Chaser, jersey 12, uploaded `/Users/austin/Desktop/IMG_7946.jpeg`, submitted, and got a Download PNG link (card id `abd0c019-7ec8-4e1d-8250-7780c08007b3`).
- 2025-12-19 09:57:03: Attempted legacy parity check by opening `~/dev/usqc2025/index.html`; old UI uses image URL + sliders/rotation. Parity needs product signoff since new UI/layout differs.
- 2025-12-19 09:57:03: Decision: Keep `WRITE_SECRET` for admin routes only; do not require for public write endpoints since it must be exposed in the client. Prefer WAF/rate limiting/captcha for public abuse protection.
- 2025-12-19 09:57:57: Ran `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm lint`; both succeeded.
- 2025-12-19 09:58:50: Note: current server middleware enforces `WRITE_SECRET` for all write endpoints when set; pending user preference if we should scope secret to admin-only routes.
- 2025-12-19 10:04:51: Decision: removed visual parity requirement in `PLAN.md` per user (no longer needed).
- 2025-12-19 10:08:50: User feedback: WAF base cost not appealing for minimal traffic; will propose lighter abuse controls (keep in-memory rate limit + optional captcha) unless they explicitly want WAF.
- 2025-12-19 10:19:40: Implemented cost monitoring + kill switch: added optional AWS Budget alerts (env-driven) and SNS-triggered kill switch Lambda that writes `config/system/kill-switch.json`; API now blocks write endpoints when kill switch is enabled (cached check). Updated `PLAN.md` to mark cost monitoring done.
- 2025-12-19 10:22:04: Re-ran `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm lint`; both succeeded.
- 2025-12-19 10:22:04: Playwright submission succeeded on localhost after kill-switch changes (card id `514dbd2d-8211-4fdd-97d2-9db8f17b1cc8`, Download PNG link rendered).
- 2025-12-19 10:22:04: Question: what email(s) + monthly budget amount + warning/shutdown thresholds should I set for the cost alerts?
- 2025-12-19 10:26:05: User asked about budget cadence + what $25/month roughly maps to in submissions; will respond with monthly budget details and a rough cost-per-card estimate.
- 2025-12-19 10:31:13: Set default cost alert values in `sst.config.ts` (email `austeane@gmail.com`, $20 budget, 20% warn, 100% shutdown). Updated kill-switch guard to block all API requests when enabled.
- 2025-12-19 10:33:27: Re-ran `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm lint`; both succeeded.
- 2025-12-19 10:33:27: Playwright submission succeeded on localhost after kill-switch scope change (card id `1fc72a61-cd6a-44fe-b9cc-959b68174d36`, Download PNG link rendered).
- 2025-12-19 10:38:33: Added maintenance banner in client that checks `config/system/kill-switch.json` (polling + visibility refresh) and blocks API queries when enabled; kill switch now returns `Cache-Control: no-store`. Updated worklog accordingly.
- 2025-12-19 10:42:56: Added `KillSwitchSeed` S3 object in `sst.config.ts` so `/c/system/kill-switch.json` returns 200 with `{ enabled: false }` and avoids 403 console noise.
- 2025-12-19 10:45:23: Seeded `config/system/kill-switch.json` in S3 via CLI to clear 403s during local testing; re-ran Playwright submission with no console errors (card id `6a68a36e-5c03-4ed6-80eb-1045078a1994`). Re-ran `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm lint`.
- 2025-12-19 10:46:07: Restored auto-select of the first tournament (removed gating on `apiEnabled`) so the continue button isn't blocked during maintenance checks.
- 2025-12-19 10:48:09: Re-ran `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm lint` after auto-select tweak; Playwright submission succeeded with no console errors (card id `f8669332-6c5b-4434-a67e-f45e4dd9e8ff`).
- 2025-12-19 11:16:01: Adjusted cost monitoring infra to avoid SST budget creation errors: added `COST_ALERT_ENABLE` and `COST_ALERT_MANAGED_BUDGET` gates, always create SNS + kill-switch Lambda when enabled, and output `costAlertTopicArn` for manual budget wiring.
- 2025-12-19 11:11:01: Investigated Budgets error; `aws organizations describe-organization` shows management/payer account `220899339580` (email `austeane@gmail.com`). Linked account `737679990662` cannot create budgets until payer enables or delegates Budgets.
- 2025-12-19 11:19:34: Ran `AWS_PROFILE=prod npx sst deploy`; deploy succeeded and output `costAlertTopicArn: arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:737679990662:CostAlertTopic-61c2e37` for wiring the manual budget alert.
- 2025-12-19 11:20:04: Re-ran `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm lint`; both succeeded.
- 2025-12-19 11:22:06: Playwright prod verification succeeded: submitted card on https://dx56a7tfy0a7x.cloudfront.net using `/Users/austin/Desktop/IMG_7946.jpeg`; received Download PNG for card id `d80e06e7-53d4-469f-a066-3eefead240a1` (render key `c0e69de5.png`).
- 2025-12-19 11:22:22: Decision: Playwright file picker click was intercepted by overlay text; used `page.setInputFiles('input[type="file"]', ...)` to upload the test image and continue verification.
- 2025-12-19 11:29:34: Removed in-repo budget/kill-switch system per request: deleted cost alert infra from `sst.config.ts`, removed kill-switch middleware in `server/src/index.ts`, deleted `server/src/budgetKillSwitch.ts`, and removed maintenance polling/UI from `client/src/App.tsx`.
- 2025-12-19 11:29:34: Updated `PLAN.md` to mark cost monitoring as manual/account-level (no in-app kill switch).
- 2025-12-19 11:29:34: Note: skipping lint/type-check/Playwright this turn per user request.
- 2025-12-19 11:32:34: Marked cost monitoring as complete in `PLAN.md` (manual/account-level budgets, no in-app kill switch).
- 2025-12-19 11:45:18: Added Sentry client monitoring (`@sentry/react` init in `client/src/main.tsx` with DSN, tracing, replay, logs) and optional Sentry sourcemap upload via `@sentry/vite-plugin` (only runs when `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is set). Added `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` to `client/.env.development` and `client/src/env.d.ts`.
- 2025-12-19 11:45:18: Added GitHub Actions deploy workflow on push to main (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) using AWS OIDC (`AWS_ROLE_ARN` secret), `AWS_REGION`/`SST_STAGE` vars, and optional `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` for sourcemaps.
- 2025-12-19 11:45:18: Updated `PLAN.md` to mark Monitoring and CI/CD complete.
- 2025-12-19 11:45:18: Note: skipped Playwright this turn per user request; lint/type-check still pending for this change set.
- 2025-12-19 11:45:58: Ran `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm lint`; both succeeded (turbo output warnings about missing outputs for lint/type-check tasks).
- 2025-12-19 11:46:40: Decision: implemented Sentry manually (init + Vite plugin) instead of running the interactive wizard; sourcemap upload is enabled when `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is provided.
- 2025-12-19 11:50:14: Checked AWS CLI for region and identity: `AWS_PROFILE=prod aws configure get region` returned `us-east-1`; `aws sts get-caller-identity` returned assumed role `AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_f870f5d8dd2a9ab9` in account `737679990662`.
- 2025-12-19 11:53:53: Question: need the GitHub repo slug (owner/name) and desired IAM role name for GitHub Actions OIDC so I can create the AWS IAM role/provider via CLI.
- 2025-12-19 11:56:58: Created GitHub Actions OIDC provider and IAM role via AWS CLI for `austeane/trading-card-app` main branch; role ARN `arn:aws:iam::737679990662:role/trading-card-app-github-actions` with `AdministratorAccess` attached.
- 2025-12-19 11:58:33: Used gh CLI to set repo secret `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and vars `AWS_REGION=us-east-1`, `SST_STAGE=production` for `austeane/trading-card-app`.
- 2025-12-19 12:04:18: Triggered a one-off Sentry client error via Playwright on production (`Sentry test error (one-off)`) so the event should appear in Sentry.
- 2025-12-19 12:14:06: Set GitHub Actions secret `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` for `austeane/trading-card-app` via gh CLI.
- 2025-12-19 12:20:41: Removed WRITE_SECRET entirely: admin routes no longer require auth in `server/src/index.ts`, admin UI secret input and auth headers removed in `client/src/Admin.tsx`, and `VITE_WRITE_SECRET` removed from `client/src/api.ts`, `client/src/env.d.ts`, and `client/.env.development`.
- 2025-12-19 12:21:18: Ran `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm lint`; both succeeded (turbo output warnings about missing outputs for lint/type-check tasks).
- 2025-12-19 12:22:00: Updated `PLAN.md` to note WRITE_SECRET removal and that admin endpoints/auth are pending a new security approach.
